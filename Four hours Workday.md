# Four Hours Workday

## An example of time management

I read the article [Daily Routine of a 4 Hour Programmer](http://www.jayonsoftware.com/home/2012/1/9/daily-routine-of-a-4-hour-programmer.html) this morning, and I call it *Four Hours Workday* (4HWD) model.

The following is summary of daily routine of the programmer.

***Daily routine***

## Implications

Time management is crucial for effective life and work. The author provided us a vigorous case and there are some implications:

- A day's work *starts* from the end of the day before.
  - The case above told us that it is important to assigns work for the brain before going to bad.
    Our brain will start to think about the work during the eight hours we are sleeping. 
  - It is also important to make a to-do list for the next day. Then when we wake up, we can start a day with specific schedule.
  
- Assign your most efficient time to carry on the most important things.
  Just turn off all communications and focus entirely on your work.
  I believe it is more effective to use such time on innovative or creative work.

- After the most creative part of a day, we should exercise, reading books, learning new things. Such activities provide ideas for our future work or writings.

- At the end of a day, we should do some reflection.
  - One is talking with workmates to conclude a day's work and find what have we done and what should we change for the future.
  - The other is reflect on your own before go to bed. Just think about what have we done, learned and what should we do next.

  ***Life is a cycle and we should make it a perfect one.***
